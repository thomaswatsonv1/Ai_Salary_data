### Suggested Models

1. **Random Forest Regressor**:
   - A powerful ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting.
   
2. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**:
   - Another ensemble technique that builds trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects errors made by the previous ones. It often yields better performance than Random Forest in many cases.

3. **XGBoost Regressor**:
   - An optimized version of gradient boosting that is designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable. It often performs well in competitions and real-world applications.

### Streamlit Frontend

To create a basic frontend using Streamlit, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Streamlit**:
   Make sure you have Streamlit installed in your environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
   ```

2. **Create a Streamlit App**:
   Below is an example code snippet to create a simple Streamlit app that allows users to input features and get predictions from your models.

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import joblib  # For loading your trained models

# Load your trained models
rf_model = joblib.load('random_forest_model.pkl')
gb_model = joblib.load('gradient_boosting_model.pkl')
xgb_model = joblib.load('xgboost_model.pkl')

# Streamlit app title
st.title("AI Job Salary Prediction")

# Input features
st.header("Input Features")
years_experience = st.number_input("Years of Experience", min_value=0.0, max_value=10.0, step=0.1)
benefits_score = st.number_input("Benefits Score", min_value=-3.0, max_value=3.0, step=0.1)

# Add more input fields based on your dataset
# For example, if you have skills as binary features:
skill_AWS = st.selectbox("AWS Skill", [0, 1])
skill_Azure = st.selectbox("Azure Skill", [0, 1])
# Add other skills as needed...

# Create a DataFrame for the input
input_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'years_experience': [years_experience],
    'benefits_score': [benefits_score],
    'skill_AWS': [skill_AWS],
    'skill_Azure': [skill_Azure],
    # Add other features...
})

# Prediction button
if st.button("Predict Salary"):
    rf_prediction = rf_model.predict(input_data)
    gb_prediction = gb_model.predict(input_data)
    xgb_prediction = xgb_model.predict(input_data)

    st.subheader("Predicted Salaries")
    st.write(f"Random Forest Prediction: ${rf_prediction[0]:,.2f}")
    st.write(f"Gradient Boosting Prediction: ${gb_prediction[0]:,.2f}")
    st.write(f"XGBoost Prediction: ${xgb_prediction[0]:,.2f}")

# Run the app
# Save this code in a file named app.py and run it using the command:
# streamlit run app.py
```

### Steps to Follow

1. **Train Your Models**: Train the Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost models on your dataset and save them using `joblib` or `pickle`.

2. **Create the Streamlit App**: Use the provided code as a starting point. Modify the input fields according to the features in your dataset.

3. **Run the Streamlit App**: Save the code in a file (e.g., `app.py`) and run it using the command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Interact with the App**: Open the provided URL in your browser to interact with the app and make predictions.
